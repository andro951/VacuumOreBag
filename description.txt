Vacuum Ore Bag is a mod that adds a bag that stores ores, bars, gems, sand and glass.
It automatically picks up items if vacuum is toggled on, and is compatible with Magic Storage.
Bags only require 1 simple ModItem file and a Mod.Load() call to make.  See OreBag.cs and VacuumOreBag.cs.

This mod is built like an example mod to show off how to create a bag with androLib.
See androLib for more information on how to create your own bags:
